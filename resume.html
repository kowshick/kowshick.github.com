                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Cars Accident Response System (C.A.R.S)</b>: The app connects the phone bluetooth to the system's bluetooth which is interfaced with micro controller that detects the accident and sends an signal to the app via bluetooth. The App on receiving the signal sends the alert message contaning GPS coordinates and address of the accident location to the near by hospital</li>
                    <li><b>RFID Smart Cane</b>: A cane that uses RFID technology and detects the surroundings embedded with RFID tags and sends a voice signal to the blind person who's using that cane</li>
                    <li><b>Human action copying mechanical arm</b>: Human arm is tracked usng Kinect sensor using which co-ordinates  of various arm joints are determined and sent to Microcontroller via UART. The co-ordinates are processed by the microcontroller and required PWM with appropriate duty cycle is generated to control the position of servo motors which imitates the human arm. </li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Introduced the concept of <b>'Tech Talks'</b>- a short lecture series on various components and techniques used in the club's project.</li>
