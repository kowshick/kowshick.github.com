          	<h5> Abstract:</h5>
          	<p>
          		The goal of this project is to design a 4X1 SRAM.
			The SRAM consists of the basic 6T cell. Each bit is accessed
			using a 4 bit address word. Read and Write strobes are qualified
			(i.e. conditionally clocked) by a clocked driver using a nonoverlapping
			clock phase 1 to synchronise the read and write
			access. Bit-line pre-charge circuitry are placed above each column
			and qualified by clock phase 2. The data write and sense
			amplifier are placed below the SRAM core. In addition to
			successfully implementing the proposed design, it is ensured that
			the area of the layout is kept as minimal as possible.

                Designed different coarse grain reconfigurable multiply and accumulate units improving it's efficiency in terms of <i> power </i>and <i>worst case delay </i>over the existing designs.

              <li>
                In the proposed system, an N-bit precision Multiplier in the MAC unit architecture will consist of n smaller blocks of 2<sup>(N/n)</sup>-bit precision. For example, an 8-bit AU will consist of 4 nos. of 4-bit AU. 

              </li>
              <li>
                Truncation logic used in this design will truncate higher precision input to lower precision based on the input wordlength. This increases the speed of operation and lower the power consumption of multiplier operation by compromising on the accuracy of ouput over the error free multipliers. 
              </li>
              <li>
			  This introduction of errors has observed to have increased the efficiency of processing without compromising much in the qualtiy of output. This has been proved by using this MAC unit in FIR filtering to perform unsharp masking on images (Results can be seen below).

    <h3>Power Flow Managment System</h3>
    <h5>Guide</h5><i>Dr.Saravana Ilango, Assistant Professor, NIT Trichy</i>
    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    <p>
              
 This work aimed at maximizing the use of solar energy by charging the battery as well as by supplying it to the loads when in excess. This system is implemented using two subsystems namely a charge controller and a Power Flow Management System(PMS). <ul>The charge controller is used to control the power flow from the PV module to the battery by operating in two modes. <li>The <em>Maximum Power Point Tracking mode(MPPT)</em> extracts maximum power from PV panels and the <em>voltage control mode</em> prevents overcharging of the battery. </li>
 <li> A control strategy is formulated in the PMS to criterion.</li>
 <li>The SoC is determined using <em> coulometric measurements</em> and is periodically recalibrated using Open Circuit Voltage method.</li>

                <em> This work has been presented in <a href="http://africon2013.org">Africon 2013</a> an IEEE conference held at Mauritius and has been accepted for publishing</em>   
                <h5>Abstract</h5>.
                <p>The aim of this work was to develop an embedded system directed at automating appliances in an industry via Ethernet.</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>The system employs server/client architecture; switching commands for the appliances which are connected to the client, were received and displayed at either end using TFT display.</li>
                   <li>The data containing information about the control commands are transferred between the end points of communication using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).</li>
                   <li>The remote host processes the commands received and translates them into actions of switching particular appliances ON or OFF. </li>
                </ul>
                             <table class="table table-bordered table-hover">

      <h5>Results:</h5>          
       This type of control system gives the liberty for control of appliances from remote locations connected
       through Ethernet. Moreover, this system is independent of dedicated PC as it uses a novel embedded system implemented on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>It is of essential that residential and industrial consumers of electrical energy should be aware of the energy being consumed by certain appliances and it's performance in terms of power factor in real time at greater accuracy.
              The existing residential Energy meters in India are incapable of measuring the apparent power thus measuring lesser quantity than it is being consumed.</p>

            <li>Interfacing light sensor to <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/cc2530dk">Zigbee</a> microcontroller to measure the ambient light intensity</li>
            <li>Interfacing Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) sensors to Zigbee micro to detect the change in IR rays which detects the human motion in that environement. </li>
            <li>Developed efficient embedded code to automatize the lighting status in that region based on the information on luminous intensity and human motion obtained from the PIR and light sensors.</li>
