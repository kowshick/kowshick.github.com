            <h3>Control of Home Appliances from remote location</h3>
            <h5>Guide:</h5><p>Prof. Reddy, NITT(September 2012 - present)</p>
            <h5>Abstract</h5>
            <p>
                The objective is to create a centralized monitoring ability and controlling capability of home appliances from a remote location from within a local area network. TCP protocol was used to establish a ethernet communication through a host server computer which hosts the web application which can be accessed form any computer available on the local area network, the status and control packet along with destination controller address is generated and sent from the web app as per the command given by the user. This packet is received by Ardiuno ethernet shield which converts the packet information into serial data. The serial data is sent to all the embedded system sub module each possessing unique address. The micro controller which possess address as that is contained by the incoming data is processed and appliances status are toggled and rest other micro controller ignores it...

            <h3>Power Flow Managment System</h3>
            <h5>Guides</h5><p>Professors Ilango, NITT.<br>
            <em>Course: EEE.</em> April 2012</p>
            <h5>Abstract</h5>
            <p>
              Abstract:
PV modules are increasingly used in the battery charging applications in home inverter systems due to the power crisis faced in developing countries. This works aims at maximizing the use of solar energy by charging the battery as well as by supplying it to the loads when in excess. This system is implemented using two subsystems namely a charge controller and a Power Flow Management System(PMS). The charge controller is used to control the power flow from the PV module to the battery by operating in two modes. The Maximum Power Point Tracking mode(MPPT) extracts maximum power from PV panels and the voltage control mode prevents overcharging of the battery. A 160W prototype of the charge controller is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment and is implemented in hardware. The operation of the controller in two modes is verified and the relevant results are presented. A PV system implemented in houses involves various power sources and sinks. A control strategy is formulated in the PMS to criterion. The SoC is determined using coulometric measurements and is periodically recalibrated using Open Circuit Voltage method.

Firstly a USB to serial converter is used,but since PC sends signals at different levels, an RS232 level converter is used to convert the signals to TTL logic, MAX232 IC is used to carry out this process and TTL levels are wirelessly transmitted using CC2500 RF modules interfaced with ATMEGA 8. The receiver end module and display system is show in the above image and complete working setup is shown in the pic beside.</p>

              <p>It is of essential that residential and industrial consumers of electrical energy should be aware of the energy being consumed by certain appliances and it's performance in terms of power factor in real time at greater accuracy.
              The existing residential Energy meters in India are incapable of measuring the apparent power thus measuring lesser quantity than it is being consumed.</p>
